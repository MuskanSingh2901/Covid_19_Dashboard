This interactive Power BI dashboard provides a data-driven analysis of the global impact of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), focusing on confirmed cases, deaths, and recovery trends across different countries/regions over time.

Key Insights Displayed:

Summary Metrics at the top: 
a. Recovered Cases: 56.35K 
b. Death Count: 224.36K 
c. Confirmed Cases: 224.35K
Country-Wise Analysis: 
a. Bar & Line Combo Chart: Displays count of confirmed cases and maximum deaths per country. 
b. Right Table: Tabular summary of total confirmed cases and deaths per region, such as China, France, Japan, etc.
Trend Over Time: 
a. Bar Chart (bottom right): Shows how confirmed cases changed over time (LastUpdate Date) – highlighting peak periods of infection.
Average Deaths Per Country: 
a. A simple bar highlights average deaths by country, showing outliers like Hong Kong.
Slicer Panel (top right): Enables filtering by country/region for detailed analysis.

->Questions You Can Answer With This Dashboard: 
->Basic Summary:

What is the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths worldwide?
How many patients have recovered globally? 
->Country-Level Insights:
-Which country/region has the highest number of confirmed cases?
-Which country reported the maximum deaths?
-How does the number of deaths in Japan compare to those in France? 

->Time-Series Analysis:
-During which time period did confirmed cases spike the most?
-Is there any pattern of decline in cases toward the last update date? 

->Visual Comparison:
-Which countries had high confirmed cases but low death counts?
-Which region had the lowest death-to-confirmed-case ratio? 

->Average Metrics:
-Which country has the highest average number of deaths?
-How does Hong Kong’s death average stand out from the rest?

->Why This Project Stands Out?
-This COVID-19 Power BI dashboard stands out due to its clean, interactive, and insightful design that allows users to instantly grasp the scale and spread of the SARS-Coronavirus 2019 outbreak. It integrates key metrics like total confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries while also providing a granular view by region and over time. The effective use of slicers, line graphs, and bar charts enables users to filter data dynamically and make comparisons across countries and timelines. The combination of summary KPIs and detailed visuals makes the dashboard not only informative but also visually engaging for stakeholders and decision-makers.

->What We Learn from This Dashboard?
-From this dashboard, we learn how data visualization can help in understanding and monitoring global health crises. It teaches us to analyze and compare large datasets across multiple dimensions — such as country, timeline, and case type — to derive meaningful insights. We gain awareness of how different regions were impacted, how quickly the virus spread, and where the major spikes in infections and deaths occurred. From a technical perspective, it also demonstrates the practical use of Power BI features such as slicers, custom visuals, and dynamic filters to build a professional and data-driven story.

->Feedback
-The dashboard effectively presents complex data in an easily understandable manner. The use of visual elements like color-coded bars and combined chart types helps in quick pattern recognition. However, to improve it further, the inclusion of tooltips on hover, percentage trends, and a filter for specific date ranges could enhance interactivity and depth of analysis. Additionally, integrating population-based normalization (like deaths per million) could provide a fairer comparison across countries with different population sizes. Overall, it’s a strong and structured analytical tool with potential for further expansion.
